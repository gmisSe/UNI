## Pro 1: Zoos educate the public about animals and conservation efforts

"According to a study of 26 zoos worldwide published in _Conservation Biology_, visitors to zoos increased their knowledge of biodiversity and specific individual actions to protect biodiversity."

Only 5661 participant over only 26 zoos worldwide, people accepting to participate are more likely to respond positively.
Increase of 69.8% to 75.1% after the zoo visit in respondent demonstrating at least some positive evidence of biodiversity understanding. 
This is a really small impact compared to what they do to animals, maybe that increase is only temporary as people forget their visit to the zoo 


## Zoos produce helpful scientific research.

There are 10000 zoos worldwide 

In all, 228 accredited zoos published 5,175 peer-reviewed papers between 1993 and 2013. In 2017, 173 accredited U.S. zoos spent $25 million on research, studied 485 species and subspecies of animals, worked on 1,280 research projects, and published 170 research papers.

They do too little research compared to the money they make for it to be considered a fraction of their purpose 

According to a recent market-forecast for the “Zoos & Aquariums” industry in the United States, total market revenue is projected at about **US $4.83 billion** in 2025

# Opponents arguments 

## Argument 1
with the zoos we can protect, they help to understand animas behaviors and reproduction cycle, the prevent the extinction of some animals
With the zoos we can prevent the disparition of certain species in the world, they serve to repair the damage we've done to the world 

Animal studies

Prevent the disparition of certain species in the world, the disparition we caused
## Argument 2
Today modern zoos can save animals, it's a safe place for them, it's a place that always animals to live in peace without dangers

A lot of animals will not survive climate change, pollution and deforestation
this is why zoos exist, to protect and save animals, around 250000 around the world have been rescued and treated during disasters around the world. The public like animals and understand that we need to protect animals form disasters and protection. 

A lot of animals will not survive climate change, pollution  and deforestation, we must protect them by making zoos 
## Argument 3
Public education and awareness, make children understand that it's important to protect biodiversity. Since humans are largely responsable for climate change, pollution and deforestation, some argues that it's important that human protect animals in zoos. 

It helps for public awareness, make children understand it's important to protect biodiversity 

Humans are responsible for the destruction of animals habitats, so now humans should make zoos to protect them
