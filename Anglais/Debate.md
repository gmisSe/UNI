Us humans consume a lot of industrial products, to be sure these products are safe we have to test them, sadly when testing without animals we can only go so far. Even tho testing products on animals in certain fields like cosmetics is now banned in EU, all the data gathered before then is still used to this day to make safe products for consumption.

can i put myself at the place of my dog and imagine him suffering for just science for humans, this is a real ethical issue, how can you call yourself a human blah blah blah nigga 

the suffering of animals, there are some experiences that are crual, we cut them while they're still alive. we open their brains. we put acide in them, we inject toxic products in them (monkeys cause they are more similar to us). We put them in very small places for their entire life then we kill them.
