### Against 
## Argument 2 Ethical/Moral argument

- Moral Wrongdoing : Harming animals is considered ethically unacceptable by many people.  
- Animals Rights Argument : Animals have intrinsic rights and should not be used as tools for human benefit. 
- Weak Ethical Standards : Laws protecting animals in labs are often insufficient or poorly enforced 
## Argument 3 Economic argument 

### For 
- Industrial Necessity: Cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries rely on animal testing for product safety 
- Risk prevention: Testing protects companies from dangerous product failures. 
- Research Employment: Animal experiments support jobs and generate economic value. 

### Against 
- Cheaper Alternatives : Modern non-animal methods can be less expensive.
- High lab costs : Maintaining animal facilities is expensive and resource-consuming
- Consumer Pressure : Growing demand for cuelty-free products pushes companies away from animal testing.

# 3 Open-Ended Questions 

### 1) How does the animal testing debate reflect broader questions about human relationships with animals ?
